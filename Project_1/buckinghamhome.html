                Buckingham Palace is one of the few working royal palaces remaining in the world today. As one of the most iconic and impressive buildings in the world, it's a must visit to experience the best of British history and culture.

                Witness the grandeur of the British monarchy and on selected dates during the summer and from November to December and at Easter, visitors can tour the 19 State Rooms, which form the heart of the Palace.

                The Royal Mews and The King's Gallery are part of the Buckingham Palace site, but have their own visitor entrances and so can be visited separately. Both venues are open for most of the year, including when the palace itself is closed.

                Try to time your visit to see Changing the Guard, a popular free event which takes place outside Buckingham Palace on certain days from 10.45am and lasts around 45 minutes, with the actual handover taking place at 11am. Be sure to arrive early to secure a spot with a good view.
